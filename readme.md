# SensoPredict

# Overview

SensoPredict is a predictive maintenance solution designed to enhance industrial plant efficiency by predicting equipment failures before they occur. Using machine learning algorithms, real-time sensor data, historical maintenance records, and operational conditions, SensoPredict helps industries reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

# Features

Real-time Sensor Data Analysis: Collects and processes live sensor data.

Predictive Maintenance: Uses machine learning models to forecast equipment failures.

Historical Data Utilization: Leverages past maintenance records for better prediction accuracy.

Customizable Alerts: Notifies plant operators about potential failures.

Dashboard Visualization: Provides intuitive charts and graphs for monitoring asset health.

# Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js (if applicable)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure
